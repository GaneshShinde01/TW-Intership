/*

This is Ganesh Shinde, intern at #TopperWorld and this is my first task to build the Number Guessing Game with the Java Programming language
 * I've used the simple to classes of util package. The first class helps to input the values from the user 
 * through standred input devices.And the second one is used to generate a stream of pseudorandom numbers.
 * 
 * In this program the system own dicides the random number, and we need to provide guess number of our own
 * then system will compare the guess number that random number and gives output accordingly.
 * 
 * we have choosen the range of numbers between 1 and 100. Player needs to guess out of them.
 * 
 * 
 * I already tried to place comments after the operations.If not understand any, ****#feel free to suggest or corrections
